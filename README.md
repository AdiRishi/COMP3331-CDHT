# COMP3331-CDHT
Assignment for networking year 2, by Adishwar Rishi (z5011984).

Steps to compile -
javac *.java

Program Usage -
java cdht_ex <peer id> <successor 1> <successor 2>

IMPORTANT NOTE -
Using the command line input for the program is extremely hard due to the frequent ping prints.
I recommend that you disable these pings before testing out the file request and graceful quit.

 Where to disable -
 In class 'PingServer' at line 107 and 111 . Just comment them out and recompile.
